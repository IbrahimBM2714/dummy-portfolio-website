<h1>Dummy portfolio website</h1>

This website was created using html and css.
I created this website to test my frontend skills when I was learning web development.

If you want experience this for yourself, you can do so by downloading the code and running the website on your browser using the Live Server extension. For those of you who don't know about Live Server, it is an extension which can be downloaded inside of Vscode.

This is what your bottom bar of vscode will look like if you have suceesfully installed the extension. Now all you have to do is click on Go Live and your website will be launched on your browser.
